# Federated Learning

This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629), and we try to attack by label flipping.   
Only experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 (both IID and non-IID) is produced by far.

## Run

The models are produced by:
> python [main_nn.py](main_nn.py)

Federated learning is produced by:
> python [main_fed.py](main_fed.py)

User needs to create a new folder /log

See the arguments in [options.py](utils/options.py). 


## Results
Results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, with the parameters C=0.1, B=10, E=5.
### MNIST
Table 1. results of 30 epochs training with the learning rate of 0.01

| Model     | Acc. of IID | Acc. of Non-IID|
| -----     | -----       | ----           |
| FedAVG-MLP| 84.42%      | 88.17%         |
| FedAVG-CNN| 98.17%      | 89.92%         |

### CIFAR10
Table 2. results of 30 epochs training with the learning rate of 0.01

| Model     | Acc. of IID | Acc. of Non-IID|
| -----     | -----       | ----           |
| FedAVG-CNN| 82.78%      | 65%         |
